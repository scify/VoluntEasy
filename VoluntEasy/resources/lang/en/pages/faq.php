    'question1' => 'How do I assign a volunteer to an action?',
    'answer1' => '<p>A volunteer may participate in an action after completing various stages. Their “journey” through the platform begins with filling in their application. The platform administrator, that is the user responsible for the root unit, assigns the volunteer to the unit.</p>
    <p>In order to proceed to the next units, three preset steps must be completed: <strong>Contact</strong> with volunteer, <strong>Interview</strong> and <strong>Assign</strong> to next unit. These steps include a comments field, and save or complete options. For example, if the administrator phones the volunteer but the latter does not respond to the call, they may note the above event in the comments field of the Contact step and save it. In this way, they may easily and quickly see the pending step on the Pending page and remember to call the volunteer at some other point.</p>
    <p>After Contact and Interview, the administrator chooses the most appropriate unit for the volunteer and assigns them to it. It then falls within the responsibility of the manager of this unit to contact and schedule an interview with the volunteer. Following this procedure, the volunteer proceeds even further within the organisation unit tree.</p>
    <p>When one unit has actions, its manager may decide if the volunteer may participate in its actions, in other words have a status <span class="status active">Active</span>, or if they will remain <span class="status available">Available</span>. at the unit until another action is created.</p>
   <p>After the action ends, volunteer status changes automatically from <span class="status active">Active</span> to <span class="status available">Available</span>.</p>',

    'question2' => 'How do I rate a volunteer?',
    'answer2' => '<p>Volunteer rating is performed by managers of the actions which the volunteer has participated in, if they have been assigned to the action. After the end of the action, an informative email is automatically sent asking the action manager to rate all volunteers who have participated in it.</p>
 <p>Rating is based on various criteria that have been set, and there is an open comment field. The manager may rate the volunteers of an action only once.</p>
 <p>Action managers may not necessarily be system users. Platform users may not rate the volunteer, but if a platform user wants to make a note about a volunteer, they may use the field “Comments” at the volunteers profile. This field is visible by all system users.</p>',
